///     Represents a set of gates that can be readily implemented and used
///     to implement simulation algorithms. Each set is described by a function
///     from integers to operations parameterized by a real number representing
///     time and a vectors of real numbers representing other generator parameters.
///     For instance, a function representing the use of Pauli rotations to
///     decompose simulations might map the integer 3 to
///     `(params, time, qubits) => Rz(time, qubits)`, with the `params` field
///     being ignored, while another gate set might use `params` to indicate
///     application of gates such as exp(-i [X cos φ + Y sin φ] t).

///     indexes on which the given term acts, and the final argument is the set
///     of real numbers parameterizing the application of the corresponding
///     operation.
///
///     From the view of a GeneratorTerm, a Hamiltonian is an operation of
///     the form (Double, Qubit[]) => () that applies $e^{-i H t}$ to the
///     state of a given register.
