<!--

    TODO:
    - write a summary
    - provide a manifest
    - references

    H2SimulationSample/README.md is probably a good example to emulate.

## Note ##

This sample depends on the operations defined in `AdiabaticIsingSample`, and builds on the techniques introduced in `PhaseEstimationSample`.
We suggest reading those samples before continuing.
