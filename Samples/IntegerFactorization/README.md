# Summary 

This sample contains Q# code implementing Shor's quantum algorithm for
factoring integers. The sample relies on the arithmetic library provided as 
a part of Microsoft.Quantum.Canon library. 

# Contents 

The sample constists of two files: 

* [Program.cs](\.Program.cs) -- the C# concole application running Shor algorithm on Quantum
  simulator
* [Shor.qs](\.Program.qs) -- Q# implementation of Shor's algorithm.
