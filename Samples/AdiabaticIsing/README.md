## Adiabatic Ising Evolution Sample ##

This sample converts a representation of a Hamiltonians using library data types into unitary time-evolution by the Hamiltonian on qubits. We consider the Ising model and study adiabatic state preparation of its ground state for the cases of uniform ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic coupling between sites.

### Running the Sample ###

Open the `QsharpLibraries.sln` solution in Visual Studio and set the .csproj file in the manifest as the startup project.
Press Start in Visual Studio to run the sample.

### Manifest ###

- `AdiabaticIsing/`
  - `AdiabaticIsingSample.csproj`: Main C♯ project for the sample.
  - `AdiabaticIsing.qs`: Q♯ code implementing quantum operations for this sample.
  - `Program.cs`: C♯ code to interact with and print out results of the Q♯ operations for this sample.

## Note ##

This sample builds on results in `IsingGeneratorsSample`.
We suggest reading that sample before continuing.
