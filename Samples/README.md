title: "Q♯ Examples"
---

This folder contains a number of different Visual Studio projects demonstrating different parts of the Q♯ language and quantum programming concepts.
We recommend getting started with the [teleportation example](./TeleportationExample/), as this example demonstrates how to use Visual Studio to build a simple quantum program and run it from within C♯.

**TODO**: Describe other examples.
