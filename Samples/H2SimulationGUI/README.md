## Hamiltonian Simulation of H₂ ##

This Sample demonstrates the use of the quantum development toolset for Hamiltonian simulation by showing how to simulate molecular hydrogen (H₂).
The sample walks through both simulating H₂ manually, and using the generator representation library provided in the canon.

### Running the Sample ###

Open the `QsharpLibraries.sln` solution in Visual Studio and set `Samples/H2SimulationGUI/H2SimulationSample.fsproj` as the startup project.
Press Start in Visual Studio to run the sample.

### Manifest ###

- `H2SimulationGUI/`
  - `H2SimulationSample.fsproj`: Main F# project for the Sample.
  - `Program.fs`: F# code to interact with the Hamiltonian simulation operations provided in the canon and to plot the results.

## Theory ##

The F# program provided with this sample compares the results of the simulation to exactly diagonalizing the Hamiltonian for each bond length.
